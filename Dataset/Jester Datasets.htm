Format:

<ol>
	<li>3 Data files contain anonymous ratings data from 73,421 users.</li>
	<li>Data files are in .zip format, when unzipped, they are in Excel (.xls) format</li>
	<li>Ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00 (the value "99" corresponds to "null" = "not rated").</li>
	<li>One row per user</li>
	<li>The first column gives the number of jokes rated by that user. The next 100 columns give the ratings for jokes 01 - 100.</li>
	<li>The sub-matrix including only columns {5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} is dense. Almost all users have rated those jokes (see discussion of "universal queries" in the above paper).</li>

<h2>Dataset 2</h2>
<h3>Over 1.7 million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 150 jokes
from 59,132 users: collected between November 2006 - May 2009</h3>
<p>
Save to disk, then unzip: <a href="jester_dataset_2.zip">jester_dataset_2.zip</a> (7.7MB)
</p>
<p>
Format:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>jester_ratings.dat: Each row is formatted as [User ID] [Item ID] [Rating]</li>
	<li>jester_items.dat: Maps item ID's to jokes</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Note that the ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00. As of May 2009, the jokes {7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} are the "gauge set" (as discussed in the Eigentaste paper) and the jokes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20, 27, 31, 43, 51, 52, 61, 73, 80, 100, 116} have been removed (i.e. they are never displayed or rated).

<h2>Dataset 2+</h2>
<h3>An updated version of Dataset 2 with over 500,000 new
ratings from 79,681 total users: data collected from November 2006 - Nov 2012</h3>

</p>
<p>
Format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In this dataset we stripped out users that did not respond to the
gauge set of question. The data is formated as an excel file representing a 66336 x 151 matrix  with rows as users and columns as jokes.</li> <li>10 of the jokes don't have ratings, their ids
are: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 }.</li><li> Each rating is from (-10.00
to +10.00) and 99 corresponds to a null rating (user did not rate that
joke). </li></ul>

 Note that the ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00. As
of May 2009, the jokes {7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} are the "gauge
set" (as discussed in the Eigentaste paper) and the jokes {1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20, 27, 31, 43, 51, 52, 61, 73, 80, 100, 116}
have been removed (i.e. they are never displayed or rated).
